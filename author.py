                        Hello world! 
                        Thank you for visiting this website application üôè. My name is Marsetio Noorprajuda.  
                        I am a machine learning scientist with a fullstack developer background.
                        I graduated from DataCamp, FreeCodeCamp, and DTSense Bootcamps.
                        There I learned data science and machine learning with Python programming language.
                        I also graduated from Hacktiv8 Indonesia Bootcamp. 
                        So I have extensive experiences both in backend and frontend using JavaScript technologies (such as Angular, React, Vue, ionic) too.
